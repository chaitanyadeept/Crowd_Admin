Each of Quadrant Resource LLC and Consultant a “Party” and together the “Parties”. </p>
                    <p>WHEREAS, one or all Parties wish to receive certain Confidential Information (as defined below) from the other for the purposes contemplated in the formal business relationship between the Parties or for the purpose of determining whether to enter into such a relationship;
                      WHEREAS, one or all Parties will disclose (each a “Disclosing Party”) Confidential Information to the other Party (each a “Receiving Party”), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement;
                      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein set forth, the Parties agree as follows:</p><br><br>

                    <p class="d-inline"><strong>1. Definition of Confidential Information</strong>: Confidential Information includes all information of whatever kind or nature, whether disclosed orally, visually, electronically or in writing, 
                      that is (a) marked or accompanied by documents clearly and conspicuously designated as “Confidential” or “Proprietary”, (b) identified orally or in writing by the Disclosing Party as confidential before, during or promptly after the 
                      presentation or communication; or (c) is not generally known in the industry in which the Disclosing Party is or may become engaged and which would reasonably be considered confidential and/or proprietary. Confidential information includes, but is not limited to, 
                      financial information, personnel information, trade secrets, and names of customers, business strategy, and product plans.
                    </p><br><br>

                    <p class="d-inline"><strong>2. Use of Confidential Information</strong>: The Receiving Party may use Confidential Information only for the purposes contemplated in the formal business relationships between the Parties or for the purpose of determining whether to enter into such a relationship. 
                      The Receiving Party further agrees to not use Confidential Information for any other purpose.
                    </p><br><br>


                    <p class="d-inline"><strong>3. Duty to Protect</strong>:  The Receiving Party shall protect the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information with the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, as the Receiving Party normally uses in the protection of its own confidential and proprietary information. 
                      The Receiving Party shall use this standard of care to prevent the unauthorized use, disclosure, dissemination, or publication of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. The Receiving Party’s duty to protect the Confidential Information shall last for a period of three (3) years from the date of disclosure.
                    </p><br><br>

                    <p class="d-inline"><strong>4. Obligations Regarding Confidential Information. The Receiving Party agrees</strong> 
                      <br>A: Not to make any disclosure of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to any third party, nor to use the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information except solely for the purposes contemplated in this Agreement unless such further use of the Confidential Information is specifically authorized in writing by the Disclosing Party.
                      <br>B: Not to disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to any personnel or representative of the Receiving Party other than those for whom such knowledge is essential for the purpose contemplated in this Agreement and such disclosure to them shall be made only under conditions of strict confidentiality.
                    </p><br><br>


                    <p class="d-inline"><strong>5. Exclusions</strong> : The restrictions set forth shall not apply with respect to Confidential Information that:
                      <br>
                      a. is already available to the public; (b) becomes available to the public through no fault of the Receiving Party, its officers, agents or employees; (c) is already known to the Receiving Party at the time that the Confidential Information is received from the Disclosing Party and is not already subject to, or protected by, a duty of confidentiality under any Confidentiality or Non- disclosure Agreements; (d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without breach of this Agreement; (e) is rightfully received by the Receiving Party from a third party without a duty of confidentiality; (f) is disclosed by the Receiving Party with the Disclosing Party’s prior written approval; or (g) is required to be disclosed pursuant to law. If a Receiving Party is required by a government body or court of law to disclose Confidential Information, the Receiving Party agrees to give the Disclosing Party reasonable advance notice so that the Disclosing Party may contest the disclosure or seek a protective order.

All Confidential Information exchanged between the Parties shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party.

                    <p class="d-inline"><strong>7. Warranty</strong>: Each Disclosing Party warrants that it has the right to make the disclosure under this Agreement. NO OTHER WARRANTIES ARE MADE BY EITHER PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. ANY INFORMATION EXCHANGED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS PROVIDED AS “AS IS”.
                    </p><br><br>

                    <p class="d-inline"><strong>8. Termination Upon Notice</strong>:  The Agreement may be terminated by the Executive upon (2) weeks’ written notice to Employer. The Company shall have the right to terminate Executive's employment with the Company at any time without Cause, upon notice to the other party.
                    </p><br><br>

Exclusive Availability</strong>: Consultant’s understands that Quadrant Resource LLC has substantially invested its time, efforts, force, and money and developed and maintained relations with its clients and if Consultant’s causes to harm Quadrant Resource LLC’s relations with its client, the damages incurred by Quadrant Resource LLC shall be indefinite and difficult to ascertain.
